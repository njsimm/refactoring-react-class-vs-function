# React Refactor: Class vs Functional Components

## Overview

This project required me to refactor a simple React application that fetches jokes from an API. I was tasked with transitioning it from class-based components to functional components using hooks. This work involved updating legacy code to align with modern React practices, demonstrating my capability to enhance and modernize existing applications.
